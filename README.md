# grading_tools

Tools for grading, more or less.

I tend to use a variety of strange grading strategies, such as dropping
the lowest exam grade or using check/plus/minus-style grading.  These
tools help me compute grade reports for students.

I record grades in a text file, with fields separated by tabs.  The
fields are username, item, grade, and notes.  For example

    rebelsky	hw4	check	with skyrebel
